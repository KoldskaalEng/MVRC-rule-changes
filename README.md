# MVRC-rule-changes
A list of suggestions for potential rule changes in mvrc

The list is broken up into 2 different type of rule changes, one-time changes, and significant changes. One-time changes are changes in RVs, RSs or mandatory parts, simple changes to the simulation case. Implementing these types of rules is a quick one-time process and don't required additional scrutineering. Significant changes are characterized by new "types" of rules, new types of results, etc. These changes might require signicant scrutineering effort, or a significant time investment to implement. 
Each suggestion is first descriped, then categorized into one of two types: type 1: onetime changes, or 2 significant changes. Finally community members that have opinions for each rule change are listed.
